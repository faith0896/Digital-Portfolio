### Reflection (STAR)

**SITUATION:**  
I was asked to complete a personality test to better understand how I work and interact with others.

**TASK:**  
The aim was to understand my personality traits to improve teamwork, leadership, and career alignment.

**ACTION:**  
I completed an online personality test based on the Myers-Briggs framework, and my result was INFJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging). I then reflected on how the traits aligned with my own personal experiences.

**RESULT:**  
I learned that I am a deep thinker, good listener, and driven by purposeâ€”qualities that are valuable in leadership and problem-solving roles.
